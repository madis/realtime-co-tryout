\begin_layout Title
Overview and comparison of some libraries providing real time communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Madis NÃµmme
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Real time communication in this writingis used in the context of web application
s.
 Traditional approach is the request-response mechanism.
 Real time means that information provider (server or other users of a site
 or service) can publish their data and it will be received by subscribers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the following, first two(Socket.io and Faye) are open source projects.
 Realtime.co and Pusher are commercial services, that let developer use their
 infrastructure and libraries to communicate with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Socket.io

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Socket.io is a library for node.js(V8 javascript VM for server side use) that
 allows developers to push messages from server to clients.
 Out of the box it is a publish-subscribe mechanism for server and client.
 Both the server and the client can be in the roles of publisher and subscriber.
 There needs to be central server where clients can connect to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a bit of custom development, the server can function as a message router
 or hub.
 Thus allowing client to client messaging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Features and benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fallbacks to different transport mechanisms when WebSocket is not available
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Namespaces (i.e.
 clients can connect to /administrators or /visitors)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Concept of rooms.
 A message can be broadcasted to all clients being in a room.
\end_layout

.
 It is also a server-client publish-subscribe type solution.
 Faye is widely used in web applications written in Ruby.
 In these cases the web application needs to be run in a event driven web
 server.
 Currently Thin, Rainbows and Goliath web servers are supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Features and benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adapter implementations in Ruby and Node.js
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Easier to integrate if the web application is already implemented in Ruby(e.g.
 Rails or Sinatra).
 With socket.io there is a need to possibly duplicate the model code and
 other things for the web application and the messaging server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Better nesting of resources where to subscribe (e.g.
 /messages/private/:user_session_id).
 Goes well together with the REST concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Realtime.co

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A commercial product that provides publish-subscribe mechanism.
 The company hosts message server so developers usually only develop message
 clients.
 These can be in browser or in server.
 This takes away some flexibility but at the same time can give more reliability.
 Messaging in Realtime.co is done in terms of channels.
 Interested parties will subscribe to channels.
 They can have different permissions on channels (e.g.
 listen or write).
 There is no built in concept of rooms or namespaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Features and benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No need to have server infrastructure for messaging.
 Server can deal only with serving web application data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scales well when there are many clients and many messages (millions of messages
 per second).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Client to client(browser to browser) messaging out of the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Library implementations for multiple platforms and languages (Node, .NET,
 Ruby, etc.).

\begin_layout Standard
Also a commercial service.
 Provides similar functionality as the Realtime.co.
 Internally uses WebSockets and has fallbacks to Flash socket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Features and benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mostly the same as in Realtime.co.
 But in addition to these:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rooms and namespaces are also supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Provides REST API for communication between server webapp to Pusher service.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These four solutions all serve one purpose - to enable pushing state from
 server to browsers (or other consumers of the service).
 First two are open source, latter two are commercial solutions.
 Commercial solutions can have the benefit of scaling better and providing
 a bit more out-of-the-box functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I personally have implemented solutions in Faye and Socket.io and proponent
 of in open source development.
 The open source solutions have more flexibility.
 They also often adopt faster to new changes in the browser-server wild
 evolution.
 Most web applications don't need to be in massive scale.
 Serving few hundred to thousand simultanious connections with socket.io
 or Faye is not a problem on current hardware.
 The bottlenecks are usually in the business logic and database components.
 So developers need to make components serving these areas to scale rather
 than the message pushing component.
